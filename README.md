# <p align = 'center'> Predicting and Analysis of Credit Card Defaulters In Taiwan</p>

## OVERVIEW

The main scope for this project is to predict the occurence of credit card defaulter based on a customers previous history.
The data provided in the csv file are in huge dimensions and the data used here is a PCA of multidimensions data reducing the dimensions so that we can handle with limited computational resources.

This Python prject describes the implementation and data visualization of 6 `supervised machine learning techniques` implemented on the kaggle dataset of credit card defaulters. As the data is huge in terms of calculations i have used google colab and so first few steps are dedicated for setting up cloud environment.

The dataset is collected from `UCI Machine Learning Repository` - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)

## DATA DESCRIPTION

1. ID: ID of each client
2. LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit
3. SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
4. EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
5. MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
6. AGE: Age in years
7. PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months,8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)
8. PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)
9. PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)
10. PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)
11. PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)
12. PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)
13. BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
14. BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
15. BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
16. BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
17. BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
18. BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
19. PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
20. PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
21. PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
22. PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
23. PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
24. PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
25. default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)

## METHODOLOGY

1. Importing Libraries and other dependencies
2. Performing `Data Visualisation` and `Analysis`
3. Observing `Correlation` between features of the dataset
4. `Cleaning` and `Preprocessing` the data
5. Performing `Feature Scaling` of Numerical Attributes
6. Applying Machine Learning Algorithm for `Classification` Problem 
7. Applying `Grid-Search CV` and check if the accuracy is increased or not
8. `Evaluate the performance` of the model

Machine Learning Techniques used:

1) SVM
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) Logistic Regression
5) K nearest neighbours
6) Ensemble classifier using decision trees

## CONCLUSION

* Using a Logistic Regression classifier, we can predict with 82.5% accuracy, whether a customer is likely to default next month.
* Using a Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier, we can predict with 83.33% accuracy, whether a customer is likely to default next month.
* Using a Support Vector Machine classifier, we can predict with 80.83% accuracy, whether a customer is likely to default next month.
* Using a K-Nearest Neighbour classifier, we can predict with 80.83% accuracy, whether a customer is likely to default next month.
* Using a Decision Tree classifier, we can predict with 82.83% accuracy, whether a customer is likely to default next month.
* Using a Random Forest classifier, we can predict with 81% accuracy, whether a customer is likely to default next month.
* Using a XGBOOST classifier, we can predict with 82.16% accuracy, whether a customer is likely to default next month.
* The strongest predictors of default are the PAY_X (ie the repayment status in previous months), the LIMIT_BAL & the PAY_AMTX (amount paid in previous months).
* We found that using Stochastic Gradient Descent and Decision Tree are better.
